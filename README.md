# SteamVR-Dongle-Flash
A simple Guide and batch script to flash steam controller dongles to watchman dongles for SteamVR/OpenVR

## Tested and Working
 - As Of 4/26/19
 
## Requirements

- A steamVR controller Dongle purchasable on ~~[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/530260/Steam_Controller_Wireless_Receiver/)~~
  - [alternative dongle](https://www.virtualbuilds.com/product-page/usb-wireless-receiver-dongle) I haven't tried but should work, since dongle no longer purchaseable from steam.
- SteamVR installed on your computer

## WARNING

- Please Assume this change is permanent
- This will flash ALL CONNECTED dongles, remove any before hand that you don't want flashed.

## Guide

- Remove ALL SteamVR dongles, including the HMD.
- Exit Steam
- Plug in your Steam Controller Dongle to a USB.
- open a Command Prompt (cmd or power shell)
- Navigate to where SteamVR app is installed on your computer (default is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR)
  - Powershell CMD - `cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR'`
- Run the Command `tools\lighthouse\bin\win32\lighthouse_watchman_update.exe -D tools\lighthouse\firmware\vr_controller\archive\htc_vrc_dongle_1461100729_2016_04_19.bin`
- Restart Steam, plug your dongles in, close the command prompt/powershell and you should be good to go!

## Notes

- You should be able to flash multiple dongles at once, and not need to remove old ones, but as general precaution I advise against it.
- **This should be considered permanent** In theory its not but I can't seem to find anyone who has successfully flashed firmware back, and my own attempts are unsuccssful.
- There is a firmware that will Permanatly change the dongle, but you must be signed up for the SteamVR HDK Directions on how to do so can be found [here](https://partner.steamgames.com/vrlicensing)

## Batch File
- The Batch File is designed as a one click solution to do it for you.
  - **NOTE** the batch file only works if Steam and SteamVR are installed to default directories in the C: drive.

## What should I see

- If the command is run you should see something similiar to this image:
